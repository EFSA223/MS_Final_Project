# Final Project for New Maps Plus MS

Etienne Sambo,
January - Juny 2020


I have selected a number of projects that have to do with my island Curaçao. There are a number of subjects that are administratively well presented. I think that using a digital interactive map (webmap) can provide a better overview.
With these digital Maps I want the majority of the population to have the same information at their disposal.

## 1. Public transportation
I want to design a map that is accessible to everyone. Firstly for the residents of Curaçao and secondly all the tourists who visit the island and want to take public transport and want to know that it is on the right route.
When I search the company's [website](http://autobusbedrijf.org/), I get a lot of information but there is no map. See some comments from tourists on [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g147277-i583-k9966587-Map_with_bus_routes-Curacao.html). A comment on tripadvisor leads me to this [Map](https://16byte.de/abc-route-map/).
I think that this will be a good challenge, although the company is working on a route planner.

### Challenges
- Search for data (routes, busstops, POI, prices, ect.)
- Show all the .. routes on the map
- Select and highlight route
- Give bus stops
- Navigate the route
- Give more [information](http://autobusbedrijf.org/media/2020/02/orario-salida-rutanan.pdf) abbout the route and prices
- Show some point of interest


## 2. Architectural Walking Guide
Willemstad, Curaçao has been on the World Heritage List since December 1997. There is an [analogue guide](https://www.curacaoinfo.org/media/uploads/2015/07/15/CTB_Walkingguide_2015.pdf) of the city with walking routes to admire the architecture. I like to make this guide digital together with all the others [monuments (Lánthùisnan)](https://monumentenzorg.cw/lanthuisnan-di-korsou/) on the island so that it becomes more accessible to more people.

### Challenges
- Digitaze the Walking route
- Higlight routes
- Navigate the route
- Show different picture of the monuments
- Give information ot the monuments


## 3. Traffic accidents from Curaçao or The Netherlands
Oefff, car accidents is a problem in every city. Minor accidents with material damage to major accidents with fatal consequences. Everyone wants a safe traffic. I want to design and publish a map that displays these traffic accidents so that the public can get to know where the the unsafe places are.
This can be a build on my last [Map675 project](https://efsa223.github.io/Vehicle_Crashes/), I can add more functionality.

### Challenges
- Change location use different data from [Curaçao](https://www.facebook.com/forensyscuracao/) or [The Netherlands](http://www.nationaalgeoregister.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/4gqrs90k-vobr-5t59-x726-4x2unrs1vawz).
- Filter on categorie, minor to fatal accident
- Add time slider to go true the years
- Use of Mapbox GL JS
