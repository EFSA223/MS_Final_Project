## 3. Traffic accidents from The Netherlands

Traffic accidents is a problem in every city. Minor accidents with material damage to major accidents with fatal consequences. Everyone wants a safe traffic.

- Wat is de officiÃ«le definitie van een verkeersdode?


I want to design and publish a map that displays these traffic accidents so that the public can get to know where the unsafe places are.
This can be a build on my last [Map675 project](https://efsa223.github.io/Vehicle_Crashes/), I can add more functionality.

- killed and seriously injured in traffic
- fatalities by mode of transport
- road deaths by province per 100 thousand inhabitants
- How has the number of road deaths in the Netherlands developed over the past ten years?
-
What is the risk per transport mode of dying in traffic?
