# The Netherlands Interactive Traffic Accidents Map.

Traffic accidents is a problem in every city. Minor accidents with material damage to major accidents with fatal consequences. According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries), 1.35 million people die from road accidents every year. Everyone wants a safe traffic.

I want to design and publish a map that depicts these road accidents so that the public can learn how many tragic accidents happen every day on roads they use and hope that everyone will pay more attention in traffic.

Maybe this can be a build on my last [Map675 project](https://efsa223.github.io/Vehicle_Crashes/), I can expand this with more functionality and combine it with other public issues.

## Map realization
- Show all accident on map
  - Categorize this per damages
  - and nature of the Accidents
- Slider, Let user swiftly slide through the years
- Overlay with other socio-demographic Data
