# The Interactive Road Accidents Map (The Netherlands)

## I. Introduction

Road accidents are a problem in every city. These range from minor accidents with material damage to major accidents with fatal consequences. According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-Road-injuries), approximately 1.35 million people die from road accidents every year. In the Netherlands there are approximately 120,000 Road accidents in which 650 people die. In 20??, the Dutch Caribbean island of Cura√ßao witnessed 12,750 accidents and 17 deaths. Everyone wants safe traffic. To accomplish this, everybody has to be informed and be responsible. I want to contribute with a interactive web-map.

This project and resultant map shows the traffic accidents in Utrecht, The Netherlands. The public can use this map to visually discover how many accidents occur each year and where.

## II. Methodology

The file Accidents registered in the Netherlands is a file with the accident reports of the police linked to the digital road network. This data is intended to perform various road safety analyzes and made available by [Bestand geRegistreerde Ongevallen Nederland (BRON)](http://www.nationaalgeoregister.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/4gqrs90k-vobr-5t59-x726-4x2unrs1vawz). I use the data: "Road accidents - Netherlands 2015-2018".

The mapped geometries are point-level features that shows the location of the accidents, as well as polygons for the administrative areas.

Tools used for data wrangler and management include:

- Libre Office (spreadsheet)
- Postgress Database
- QGIS

### A. Data

After downloading the data (see **dataStructure.md**), I imported all csv files into a PostgreSQL database and created the table relations. Using a sql-query, I made a selection of the data I need and exported it to a CSV file, **VerkeersOngevallenNED_2009-2018.csv**.

QGIS was used to initially visualize the data and to export to GeoJSON.

Due to the high privacy sensitivity of the data, detailed attributes have been completely removed from the SOURCE by the owner:

- Party additions
- Victims
- Vehicle characteristic data
- Vehicle characteristics reference files (time, days, months, age classes ect.)
- License plates

### B. Medium for delivery

The map is a web browser-based application accessible across desktop devices. Various web technologies and JavaScript libraries were used:

- [HTML Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
- [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
- [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [JQuery library](https://jquery.com/)
- [D3 library](https://d3js.org/)
- [Leaflet Sidebar](https://github.com/Turbo87/sidebar-v2)

### C. Application layout

An initial wireframe provides direction for the layout of the web application.

### D. Thematic representation

#### Map realization

The following map requirements help fulfill the user goal of exploring traffic accidents:

- Show all accident on map
  - Categorize per damages
  - and nature of the Accidents
- Slider, Let user swiftly slide through the years
- Overlay with other socio-demographic Data
  - population
  - Total road vehicles
  - alarms from the fire brigade

### E. User interaction

When opening or starting the application a standard map will project the type of accidents (fatal, Injury and properties damage). The user can then sequence through various years using a slider control user interface. Selecting different parameters allows targeted filtering. The basic functions are also available to the users. Pan / Zoom and click on function to get more information.

### F. Conclusion

Traffic accidents remain a current topic. Governments around the world have taken steps to make traffic as safe as possible. But the main cause of most accidents remains the human factor. By providing as much information as possible about the status of road safety, the accidents can become less and less.
