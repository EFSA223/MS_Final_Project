# Final Project for New Maps Plus MS

Etienne Sambo,
January - Juny 2020


I have selected a number of projects that have to do with my island Curaçao. There are a number of subjects that are administratively well presented. I think that using a digital interactive map (webmap) can provide a better overview.
With these digital Maps I want the majority of the population to have the same information at their disposal.

## 1. Public transportation
I want to design a map that is accessible to everyone. Firstly for the residents of Curaçao and secondly all the tourists who visit the island and want to take public transport and want to know that it is on the right route.
When I search the company's [website](http://autobusbedrijf.org/), I get a lot of information but there is no map. See some comments from tourists on [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g147277-i583-k9966587-Map_with_bus_routes-Curacao.html). a comment on tripadvisor leads me to this [Map](https://16byte.de/abc-route-map/).
I think that this topic will be a good challenge.

### Challenges
- Search for data (routes, busstops, POI, prices, ect.)
- Show all the .. routes on the map
- Select and highlight route
- Give bus stops
- Navigate the route
- Give more [information](http://autobusbedrijf.org/media/2020/02/orario-salida-rutanan.pdf) abbout the route and prices
- Show some point of interest

## 2. Architectural Walking Guide



## 3. Traffic accidents from Curaçao or The Netherlands
