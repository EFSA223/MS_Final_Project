# Final Project for New Maps Plus MS

Etienne Sambo,
January - Juny 2020


I have selected a number of projects that have to do with my island Curacao. There are a number of subjects that are administratively well presented. I think that using a digital interactive map (webmap) can provide a better overview.
With these digital Maps I want the majority of the population to have the same information at their disposal.

## 1. Public transportation
I want to design a map that is accessible to everyone. Firstly for the residents of Curacao and secondly all the tourists who visit the island and want to take public transport and want to know that it is on the right route.


## 2. Architectural Walking Guide



## 3. Traffic accidents from Curacao or The Netherlands
