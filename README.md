# Curaçao Public Transportation

I have always found it interesting to use public transportation when I am abroad. Time and time again I make a comparison with public transport on the island. My conclusion is always that public transportation on the island can be organized much better.
By creating a interactive web map, I want to contribute on solving part of the problem.

What I want to achieve with this digital map is that it is accessible to everyone. All relevant information for what concerns public transportation is available. For example all bus stations, routes, departure times, all available bus stops and rates.

I also want to display various statistical information from the last 10 years if available.
- number of passengers per route per day, month and year.
- peak hours, when and which routes are the busiest.
- display the trend in graphs.

## Map realization
- Mouseover on bus station to show routes to destinations
- Show all the routes and bus stops on the map (Electrical Circuit Diagram)
- Click on routes for more information (Destination, departure times and rate)
- Possibilities to select and highlight Routes
- Simulate navigation
- Trip Planner ([Routing](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/tutorials/basic-usage/) Optional)
